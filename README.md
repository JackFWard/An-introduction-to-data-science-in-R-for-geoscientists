# "An introduction to data science in R for geoscientists" workshop installation instructions

## Step 1: Install R

We will use R version 4.3.3 for the workshop. It can be installed via the following links:

### MacOS
https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ – click “R-4.3.3-x86_64.pkg” (highlighted below in red) if you have an Intel Mac or “R-4.3.3-arm64.pkg” (highlighted below in blue) if you have an M-series Mac.

### Windows
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ – click the link highlighted below.

## Step 1.2: ***Windows Only*** – Install RTools

RTools allows you to build packages that use Fortran, C, and C++ code. It isn’t essential for our tutorial, but, if you don’t install it, you will get an annoying message in your console asking you to do so. Installing RTools is a bit more complicated than installing R and RStudio, but this video clearly walks you through the installation process.

## Step 2: Install RStudio

As we will see in the workshop (or if you installed RTools), the default R interface isn’t particularly user-friendly. To make our lives easier, we will use an integrated development environment (IDE) to run R. In this workshop, we will use RStudio (download: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). I have swapped my console and environment panes in the screenshot below, but RStudio should, overall, look similar to this when you open it:
